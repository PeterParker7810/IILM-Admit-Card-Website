        Dear Whoever You Are,
        <br> <br>
        We regret to inform you that your serious student responsibilities have been momentarily hijacked by a more important mission: laughing.
        <br> <br>
        Yes â€” the admit card notification looked official. Yes â€” you clicked. And yes â€” youâ€™ve been pranked. ðŸ˜„
        <br> <br>
        Quick summary: <br>
        â€¢ Was this an official email? No. <br>
        â€¢ Will you get an admit card? Not today. <br>
        â€¢ Will you be rickrolled? Absolutely. Treat it as mandatory fun. <br>

        <br>
        If you enjoyed this tiny deception, pass it on to a friend who needs a smile (or a mild eye roll). <br>
        â€” Totally Not IILM University (but we love pranks)
